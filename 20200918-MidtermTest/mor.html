                <p>Morphling is a ranged agility hero that has many flexible abilities, item builds and is leveled as a
                    very strong hard carry. He relies strongly on his attributes, and is an effective ganker. Unlike
                    other agility carries that rely on physical attacks, he relies on his powerful abilities to initiate
                    and shift into a state from which he can make a kill. Waveform lets him surge directly forward to a
                    location, damaging enemies on his path, working both as a nuke or an escape. Adaptive Strike is a
                    scaling two-part ability that blasts enemies with a jet of water, either stunning and knocking back
                    or dealing damage. Its power is based on either agility or strength. Attribute Shift allows him to
                    edit his physical being, switching it from Agility or Strength, transforming him into a strong
                    damage dealer or a tank. His ultimate, Morph, transforms him into a copy of an enemy using their
                    stats and basic abilities.</p>

                <p>For dark eons the comet circled. Held in thrall to a distant sun, bound by gravityâ€™s inexorable pull,
                    the massive ball of ice careened through the blackness between worlds, made strange by its dark
                    journey. On the eve of the ancient war of the Vloy, it punched down through the sky and lit a
                    glowing trail across the night, a sign both armies took for an omen. The frozen ball melted in a
                    flash of boiling heat, as below two forces enjoined in battle across the border of a narrow river.
                    Thus freed from its icy stasis, the Morphling was born into conflict, an elemental power at one with
                    the tides of the ocean, capricious and unconstrained. He entered the fight, instinctively taking the
                    form of the first general who dared set foot across the water, and then struck him dead. As the
                    motley warriors clashed, he shifted from form to form throughout the battle, instantly absorbing the
                    ways of these strange creatures--now a footsoldier, now an archer, now the cavalryman--until, by the
                    time the last soldier fell, Morphling had played every part. The battle's end was his beginning.</p>
